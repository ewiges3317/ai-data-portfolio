            <h2>üëã About Me</h2>
            <p>I‚Äôm Jared ‚Äî a lifelong problem solver shaped by challenge, driven by purpose, and powered by technology.</p>

            <p>From a young age, I learned to adapt. As I progressively lost my hearing, I relied on lip reading, body language, and behavioral cues to navigate school and social interactions. That early need to observe deeply and think critically sharpened my sensitivity to subtle patterns ‚Äî a skill that continues to serve me in behavior analysis, data interpretation, and user-centered AI design. Today, I wear a cochlear implant and stay fully up to date with the latest in hearing tech ‚Äî not just to survive, but to thrive.</p>

            <p>In 2015, I lost a significant portion of my eyesight. That moment could‚Äôve been the end of opportunity. Instead, it became the start of my evolution. I leaned fully into assistive technologies, and later AI, to build systems and solutions that work for me ‚Äî and for others facing similar challenges. This journey has made me an expert at using technology not just functionally, but intentionally.</p>

            <p>As a certified special education teacher with a background in applied behavior analysis, I‚Äôve led overloaded SPED teams and developed AI-driven solutions to relieve their workload. One of my most impactful tools is a FERPA-compliant script that anonymizes student IEPs and behavioral documents, allowing safe integration with large language models (LLMs). This innovation enables tailored data collection, progress monitoring, and differentiation at scale ‚Äî without compromising student privacy.</p>

            <h3>üõ† Projects I‚Äôve Built Include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>IEP & BIP Quick-Reference One-Pagers for general education staff</li>
                <li>Strategy Simplification Tools for classroom teachers</li>
                <li>Prompt Libraries & Scripts that translate behavioral goals into practical, day-to-day implementation supports</li>
                <li>Automated Data Systems to collect, visualize, and act on behavioral trends in real-time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>üéØ Mission & Goals</h3>
            <p>My mission is to bridge the gap between human needs and machine capabilities, ensuring AI enhances ‚Äî not replaces ‚Äî our capacity to care, teach, and lead.</p>

            <p>I aim to use my unique intersection of lived experience, behavioral science, and instructional expertise to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build ethical AI tools rooted in empathy and research</li>
                <li>Develop prompt libraries and automation systems that support educators and businesses alike</li>
                <li>Create scalable solutions that make differentiated instruction and individualized support both manageable and meaningful</li>
                <li>Design tools that improve access, inclusion, and equity for all users ‚Äî especially those with disabilities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Whether it's in education, EdTech, business systems, or prompt engineering, I bring a creative, human-centered approach to AI ‚Äî always looking to reduce friction, amplify impact, and solve real-world problems.</p>
